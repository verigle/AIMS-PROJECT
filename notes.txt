1. retrained the first wampln on 2021

2. start training deterministic backbone only on 2020

3. Run the rmse plot on the three  region for Aurora Small pretrained

4. run the same thing but for appendix the remaining atmospheric variables

5. run rmse grid for fine tuned model

6. run the same thing but for appendix the remaining atmospheric variables (fine tuned model)

7. scorecard evaluation_run_wampln_smalftvs_pretrained_sa

8. scorecard fine-tuned model vs big pretrained model still for wampln



9. scorecard small backbone finetuned vs small pretrained model

10. scorecard small backbone finetuned vs big pretrained model

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. scorecard evaluation_run_wampln_smalftvs_pretrained_sa
2. scorecard fine-tuned model vs big pretrained model still for wampln

3- un rmse grid for fine tuned model wampln not appendix
4- un rmse grid for fine tuned model wampln for appendix

5- Train backbone on 2021



wampln epoch 8 is not bad
